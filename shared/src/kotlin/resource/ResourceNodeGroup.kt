 * A group of resource nodes of any type

 * Instead of keeping track of individual nodes, you can just add them to this and depend on this to send resources to
 * and from the correct places
 *
 * For example, every block instance has an instance of this which is where the node templates are put into. In the case of
 * the MinerBlock, instead of the it having an outputNode attribute which is manually set to the correct one, it simply
 * calls nodes.output(resource, quantity) which finds the available node and outputs the resources
